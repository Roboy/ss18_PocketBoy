It took robots a long time look like me and have the same functions as me.
Lets take a quick look what has happened in the past!

#2 Elektro is one of the first robots, but is only functional through remote control.
Many years later Wabot is able to perceive its environment through sensors, over time
he develops sensitivity and the ability to play the piano. The next milestone represents Asimo.
This robot is very good at walking and the needed energy for this is provided by batteries in his backpack.
